Topic 11 — Rebasing in Git.    Problem in rebasing theory as well as its commands
Rebase = Moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
Instead of merging (which creates a merge commit), rebase rewrites history so your commits appear on top of another branch’s commits.

1. Why Rebase?
Cleaner history — looks like work happened in a straight line.
Avoids extra merge commits.
Makes it easier to understand project history.

2. Merge vs Rebase
Merge:
main:    A---B---C
               \
feature:        D---E
merge result:   A---B---C---M
                     \     /
                      D---E

Rebase:
main:    A---B---C
                 \
feature:          D'---E'
Here D and E are rewritten as D' and E' on top of main.


3. Hands-on: Basic Rebase in VS Code
Step 1 — Setup branches
# Create a main commit
echo "line 1" > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Add line 1"
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/rebase-demo
echo "line 2 from feature" >> file.txt
git commit -am "Add line 2 from feature"

Step 2 — Switch to main and add change
git checkout main
echo "line 2 from main" >> file.txt
git commit -am "Add line 2 from main"

Step 3 — Rebase feature branch onto main
git checkout feature/rebase-demo
git rebase main
If no conflicts → commits from feature/rebase-demo are replayed on top of main.

Step 4 — Handling conflicts in rebase
If conflict appears:
VS Code will highlight conflict markers (<<<<<<< etc.)
Fix the file manually.
Mark conflict resolved:
git add file.txt
git rebase --continue
If you want to cancel:
git rebase --abort

4. Interactive Rebase
Lets you reorder, edit, squash, or drop commits.
git rebase -i HEAD~3
You’ll see:
pick abc123 Commit message 1
pick def456 Commit message 2
pick ghi789 Commit message 3

Commands:
pick → keep commit as is
reword → edit commit message
squash → combine with previous commit
drop → remove commit

5. Important Notes
Don’t rebase public/shared branches (can break teammates’ history).
Safe to rebase your local feature branches before merging into main.











Topic 12 — Viewing History
Goal: Learn how to view and filter Git commit history, so you can easily track changes and understand project evolution.
1️⃣ Basic Commands
View commit history:    git log.    
Shows commit hash, author, date, and message.
Short, one-line view:     git log --oneline
Show graph of branches:      git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

2️⃣ Filtering Commits
By author:   git log --author="Ayush"
By date:   git log --since="2 days ago"
git log --until="2025-08-15"
<<<<<<< HEAD
By file:  git log -- <file_name>    like git log -- notes.txt
=======
By file:  git log -- <file_name>
>>>>>>> 80516bbbecc9abe91d860e7fe34a234ef243804d

3️⃣ Pretty Formats
Customize log output:
git log --pretty=oneline
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
%h → short commit hash
%an → author name
%ar → relative date
%s → commit message

4️⃣ Hands-on Exercise
1. Make a few commits on any branch:
echo "History Test 1" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "History Test 1"
echo "History Test 2" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "History Test 2"

2. View commits in different ways:
git log --oneline
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
git log --graph --all --decorate

3. Filter commits by author or file:
git log --author="Ayush"
git log -- file.txt

✅ Tip: Knowing how to view history is essential for debugging, understanding past work, and preparing for rebases or merges.
